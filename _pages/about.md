Hello Friend!

I am Ifeanyi, a budding cybersecurity engineer. I worked for a while as an IT support staff before deciding to transition into cybersecurity. It has been an interesting journey thus far. I am self-driven and constantly learning. I spend most of my time learning new frameworks and tools that are relevant to cybersecurity. I also program, working majorly with Python and its frameworks.

Of recent, Iâ€™ve been spending the majority of my time around network security. I am open to collaborating on projects.

I have worked with the following languages and frameworks
