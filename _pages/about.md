### Hello Friend!

I am Ifeanyichukwu, a cybersecurity professional passionate about protecting organizations from cyber threats and ensuring the integrity of their systems and data.

My journey into cybersecurity began in IT support, where I quickly realized how small misconfigurations could lead to significant security risks. This sparked my curiosity about vulnerabilities and fueled my transition to IT Security.

Today, I focus on safeguarding networks and systems through technical implementation, risk assessment, and the development of robust security policies. Through ongoing education and hands-on labs, I stay updated on the latest trends, tools, and techniques in the field.

With a background in IT support and extensive experience in cybersecurity, I am committed to leveraging my skills to help organizations safeguard themselves against evolving cyber threats and secure their digital infrastructure.

I am open to collaborating on projects and have worked with the following languages and frameworks.
