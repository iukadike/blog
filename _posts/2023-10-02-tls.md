In networking, a packet is the basic unit of data. Every data sent across the network is usually done as a packet. This means that if an adversary can gain access to a packet, such an adversary can launch sophisticated attacks.

In this post, I aim to document my findings and observations while performing a SEED Lab.

#### Lab Environment

```
client: 10.9.0.5
server: 10.9.0.43
proxy:  10.9.0.143
```

### TLS Client

In this section of the lab, I incrementally build a simple TLS client program using Python. The aim of this lab is to understand the essential elements and security considerations in TLS programming.

#### TLS handshake

Before a client and a server can communicate securely, both have to agree on several cryptographic parameters. The TLS Handshake Protocol is responsible for this.

The following Python code initiates a TLS handshake with a TLS server:

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3

import socket
import ssl
import sys
import pprint

hostname = sys.argv[1]
port = 443
cadir = '/etc/ssl/certs'

# Set up the TLS context
context = ssl.SSLContext(ssl.PROTOCOL_TLS_CLIENT)
context.load_verify_locations(capath=cadir)
context.verify_mode = ssl.CERT_REQUIRED
context.check_hostname = True

# Create the TCP connection
sock = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)
sock.connect((hostname, port))
input("After making TCP connection. Press any key to continue ...")

# Add the TLS
ssock = context.wrap_socket(sock, server_hostname=hostname, do_handshake_on_connect=False)
ssock.do_handshake()
print(f"=== Cipher used: { ssock.cipher() }")
print(f"=== Server hostname: { ssock.server_hostname }")
print("=== Server certificate:")
pprint.pprint(ssock.getpeercert())
pprint.pprint(context.get_ca_certs())
input("After TLS handshake. Press any key to continue ...")

# Close the TLS Connection
ssock.shutdown(socket.SHUT_RDWR)
ssock.close()
```

```python
context = ssl.SSLContext(ssl.PROTOCOL_TLS_CLIENT)    #1
context.load_verify_locations(capath=cadir)          #2
context.verify_mode = ssl.CERT_REQUIRED              #3
context.check_hostname = True                        #4
```

- while creating the TLS context, I specify `ssl.PROTOCOL_TLS_CLIENT`. This specifies that a valid cert chain and a hostname are required for the TLS connection to be successful. #1
- line #2 specifies a location that contains the CA certificates to trust for certificate verification.
- line #3 specifies that certificates are required from the other side of the socket connection; in this case, from the server.
- line #4 specifies that the certificate hostname must match the host we are visiting.

```python
sock = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)              `#1
sock.connect((hostname, port))                                        `#2
input("After making TCP connection. Press any key to continue ...")    #3
```

- line #1 creates an IPv4 socket object
- line #2 creates a socket connection
- line #3 pauses the program flow, waiting for input from the user

___

```python
ssock = context.wrap_socket(sock, server_hostname=hostname, do_handshake_on_connect=False)    #1
ssock.do_handshake()                                                                          #2
print(f"=== Cipher used: { ssock.cipher() }")                                                 #3
print(f"=== Server hostname: { ssock.server_hostname }")                                      #4
print("=== Server certificate:")                                                              #5
pprint.pprint(ssock.getpeercert())                                                            #6
pprint.pprint(context.get_ca_certs())                                                         #7
input("After TLS handshake. Press any key to continue ...")                                   #8
```

- line #1 uses the TLS context I created earlier to wrap the socket object. The default behavior is to automatically initiate a TLS handshake, but I have chosen not to do so automatically.
- line #2 initiates the TLS handshake
- lines #3 to line #7 print out information about the TLS session
- line #8 pauses the program flow, waiting for input from the user

___

```python
ssock.shutdown(socket.SHUT_RDWR)    #1
ssock.close()                       #2
```

- line #1 shuts down both sides of the TLS connection. SHUT_RDWR indicates that further sends and receives are disallowed.
- line #2 closes TLS object

Using Wireshark to capture the network traffic during the execution of the program, the following are observed:



In particular, explain which step triggers the TCP handshake, and which step triggers the
TLS handshake. Explain the relationship between the TLS handshake and the TCP handshake.
